# Funmands - The *Declarative* Command Framework

In Minecraft Java Edition 1.13, Mojang introduced [Update Aquatic](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Update_Aquatic),
along with
an overhaul for their command system, which they called [Brigadier](https://github.com/Mojang/brigadier).
Brigadier allowed for fancy syntax validation on the client-side:

Brigadier is unnecessarily complex, however. Funmands was created
to solve this unnecessary complexity and make command creation
a breeze.
